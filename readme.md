This is the third version of my **boardgame scorer** app.
It's PHP/Mysql.
First version was a "legacy" DIY procedural, but working, stuff
Second version is a POO experimental one, using iterators, traits, interfaces, manager, etc. But was made in almost the same global architecture

Now the third : **My goal is to made a stronger one**, with a good architecture.

Things i'll use :
- [ ] POO
- [ ] PDO
- [ ] COLLECTIONS
- [ ] MANAGERS
- [ ] INTERFACES
- [ ] (HERITAGE)
- [ ] TRAITS
- [ ] NAMESPACES
- [ ] BOOTSTRAP (html/css)
- [ ] CALISTHEANS OBJECTS PRACTICES
- [ ] MVC Pattern
- [ ] App in 2 parts : frontend and backend
- [ ] A web part

REM :
Also use :
- [ ] FILTERS_VALIDATE / TRAITS
- [ ] JS VALIDATION (FORMS)
- [ ] PASSWORD ENCRYPT
